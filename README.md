I created this project to test and find a way on how to use and extract intent extras from notifications with Titanium. 

To make this project work, you will need to include [bencoding.android.tools](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.Android.Tools/tree/master/dist) module. 

Notifications will be send every 5 seconds. 

### Important
It's not a working project yet, it does work just when app is totally closed, when it's in background or foregorund it shows just the splash screen. 

Thank you for any feebdack :)
